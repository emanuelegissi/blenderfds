= First, install Blender =

Blender is an integrated application that allows the creation of a broad range of 2D and 3D content. Blender provides a broad spectrum of modeling, texturing, lighting, animation and video post-processing functionality in one package. Through its open architecture, Blender provides cross-platform interoperability, extensibility, an incredibly small footprint, and a tightly integrated workflow. Blender is one of the most popular open source and free 3D graphics applications in the world. The main source for information about Blender is its main site http://www.blender.org/

Between 2008 and 2010, Blender has been entirely re-coded to improve its functions, work-flow and interface. The result of this work produced the version of the software known as Blender 2.5x, currently in beta testing.

To install Blender, download the appropriate package for your platform from http://www.blender.org/ to your computer.

The MS Windows Blender package comes with an optional self-extracting installer.

For other operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X...) you can unpack the downloaded compressed file to the location of your choice. Provided the Blender binary is in the original extracted directory, Blender will run straight out of the box. No system libraries or system preferences are altered.

= Then, install BlenderFDS add-on into Blender =

After downloading the BlenderFDS distribution from http://www.blenderfds.org/, unzip it into your computer.

Add-ons is the general term for any optional script that extends Blender's functionality. They are found in the `File > User Preferences` window in the `Add-Ons` panel. The following window tab allows you to install an add-on and enable it.

For a script to show up in the `Add-ons` panel it will first have to be installed. Click `Install Add-On` button. Locate the `blenderfds.zip` in the BlenderFDS distribution that you downloaded.

Blender extracts the add-on and copies it to the local `addons` directory.

Once installed, the add-on shows up in the panel and can be activated by clicking on the `Enable Add-on` button.

Click on the `Save As Default` button to complete the installing procedure.

BlenderFDS is ready to use.

Don't forget that Blender is still in beta testing. Sometimes the installation procedure does not work for unknown reasons. In this case, both in Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux, unzip the `blenderfds.zip` file directly to the `.blender/scripts/addons/blenderfds/` directory. Create the `blenderfds` directory if it is missing.

Then launch the Blender executable and enable the addon as explained before.

= Removing BlenderFDS =

To remove BlenderFDS from your Blender install, simply disable the BlenderFDS add-on in the `Add-Ons` panel of the `File > User Preferences` window. Then close the Blender executable and delete the `blenderfds` directory from the local `addons` directory.

= Updating BlenderFDS =

To update BlenderFDS, remove the previous BlenderFDS install, as explained in the previous paragraph, and install the new version from scratch.
