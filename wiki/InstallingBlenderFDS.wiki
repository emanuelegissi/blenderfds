Blender is an integrated application that allows the creation of a broad range of 2D and 3D content. Blender provides a broad spectrum of modeling, texturing, lighting, animation and video post-processing functionality in one package. Through its open architecture, Blender provides cross-platform interoperability, extensibility, an incredibly small footprint, and a tightly integrated workflow. Blender is one of the most popular open source and free 3D graphics applications in the world. The main source for information about Blender is its main site http://www.blender.org/

Between 2008 and 2011, Blender has been entirely re-coded to improve its functions, work-flow and interface. The result of this work produced the version of the software known as Blender 2.5x. After a long beta testing phase, Blender 2.6x series is now considered stable.

Download the appropriate package for your platform from http://www.blender.org/ and install it on your computer.

The MS Windows Blender package comes with an optional self-extracting installer.

For other operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X...) you can unpack the downloaded compressed file to the location of your choice. Provided the Blender binary is in the original extracted directory, Blender will run straight out of the box. No system libraries or system preferences are altered.

= Then, install BlenderFDS add-on into Blender =

Add-ons is the general term for any optional script that extends Blender's functionality. After installing Blender, download the latest BlenderFDS distribution package (eg: `BlenderFDS_1.2.3.zip`) from http://www.blenderfds.org/ and unzip it in a comfortable location.

After launching the Blender executable, open the the Blender `Add-Ons` panel using the `File > User Preferences` menu and clicking on the `Add-Ons` tab (1). The following window tab opens up:

For a script to show up in the `Add-ons` panel it first has to be installed. Click the `Install Add-On` button (2).

A file browser window opens up.

Locate and select the `blenderfds.zip` (3) file inside the BlenderFDS distribution package that you just downloaded and unzipped. Click the file browser `Install Add-On` button (4). Blender automatically unzips the BlenderFDS add-on and copies its content to its local `addons/blenderfds` directory.

Once installed, the add-on shows up in the `Add-ons` panel. By checking the `Enable Add-on` checkbox (5), you can activate its functionalities:

Finally, click on the `Save As Default` button (6) to complete the installing procedure and make the installation permanent.

BlenderFDS is ready to use.

To remove BlenderFDS from your Blender install, simply disable the BlenderFDS add-on in the `Add-Ons` panel of the `File > User Preferences` window. Then close the Blender executable and delete the `blenderfds` directory from the local `addons` directory.

= Updating BlenderFDS =

To update BlenderFDS, remove the previous BlenderFDS install, as explained in the previous paragraph, and install the new version from scratch.
