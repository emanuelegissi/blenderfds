Blender is an integrated application that allows the creation of a broad range of 2D and 3D content. Blender provides a broad spectrum of modeling, texturing, lighting, animation and video post-processing functionality in one package. Through its open architecture, Blender provides cross-platform interoperability, extensibility, an incredibly small footprint, and a tightly integrated workflow. Blender is one of the most popular open source and free 3D graphics applications in the world. The main source for information about Blender is its main site http://www.blender.org/

Between 2008 and 2010, Blender has been entirely re-coded to improve its functions, work-flow and interface. The result of this work produced the version of the software known as Blender 2.5x, currently in alpha testing.

To install Blender, download the appropriate package for your platform from http://www.blender.org/download/get-25-alpha/ to your computer.

Currently BlenderFDS works well only with _Blender 2.5 alpha 2_. BlenderFDS _does not work_ with older Blender versions. Future Blender versions will require some minor modifications to BlenderFDS code. We are already testing BlenderFDS with bleeding edge Blender versions. 

The MS Windows Blender package comes with an optional self-extracting installer.

For other operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X...) you can unpack the downloaded compressed file to the location of your choice. Provided the Blender binary is in the original extracted directory, Blender will run straight out of the box. No system libraries or system preferences are altered.

= Then, install BlenderFDS add-on into Blender =

After downloading the BlenderFDS distribution from http://www.blenderfds.org/, unzip it into your computer.

Then launch the Blender executable.

Add-ons is the general term for any optional script that extends Blender's functionality. They are found in the `File > User Preferences` window in the `Add-Ons` panel. The following window tab allows you to install an add-on and enable it.

For a script to show up in the `Add-ons` panel it will first have to be installed. Click `Install Add-On` button and locate the `blenderfds.zip` in the BlenderFDS distribution that you downloaded. Note: Filtering is ON by default (*.py). Turn OFF filtering to show all file types.

Blender extracts the add-on and copies it to the `../.blender/scripts/addons` folder, where `..` is your Blender installation location.

Once installed, the add-on shows up in the panel and can be activated by clicking on the `Enable Add-on` button.

BlenderFDS is ready to use.

= Removing BlenderFDS =

To remove BlenderFDS from your Blender install, simply disable the BlenderFDS add-on in the `Add-Ons` panel of the `File > User Preferences` window. Then close the Blender executable and delete the `blenderfds` directory from the `../.blender/scripts/addons` folder, where `..` is your Blender installation location.

= Updating BlenderFDS =

To update BlenderFDS, remove the previous BlenderFDS install, as explained in the previous paragraph, and install the new version from scratch.
