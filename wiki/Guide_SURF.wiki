Blender `materials` can be exported to FDS `SURFs` namelist groups.

==Default `SURF` panel==

Generic `SURF` parameters can be reached by clicking on the right button of the `property editor`:

Here is an example `SURF properties panel`:

The displayed material is going to be exported as:

{{{
&SURF ID='Hot wall' FYI='A fixed temperature boundary condition' RGB=255,140,0 TMP_FRONT=200. /
}}}

The dark orange color is being translated to its RGB counterpart.

The `free text` parameter 'TMP_FRONT=200.' is being appended verbatim to the namelist. The `free text` input box can be used to freely describe any kind of present or future FDS `SURF` parameter. The usual [Guide_Common#Free_text_data_field `free text` rules] apply.

Some parameters are not going to be exported:
 * `TRANSPARENCY`, that is set to fully opaque, thus omitted;
 * `MATL_ID`, that has the exporting flag unchecked.

==`Assign to Selected Objects` button==

Clicking this button the displayed material is assigned to all currently selected objects.

This can be very useful when having to assign the same `SURF_ID` boundary condition to many objects.

==An example of specialized `SURF` panel: burner==
