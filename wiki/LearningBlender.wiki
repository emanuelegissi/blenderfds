#summary Learning Blender

The Blender windowing system is a treat. It looks like some sort of space-ship control panel and you have never seen anything like it. The learning curve can be steep, and new users can be discouraged at first.

Once you learn it, however, you'll wish all your programs worked this way.

The following is a short list of educational resources for Blender. Many of these resources are for _Blender 2.49_, and are now being transitioned to _Blender 2.5x series_. So, please, be patient.
