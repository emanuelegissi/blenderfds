== For Your Information data fields ==

The FYI data field is used to comment the namelist group. It can be recognized by the info icon.

[http://blenderfds.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/panel/FYI.png]

The contents of the FYI data field are included in the parent namelist as this:

{{{FYI='This is an example'}}}

BlenderFDS enforces the following rules to prevent the creation of a malformed FDS case file:
 # `&` and `/` characters are not allowed,
 # no quote character is allowed.

== Free text data fields ==

The free text data field is used to freely add any kind of FDS parameter to the parent namelist group. It can be recognized by the notebook icon. To add more parameters just separate them with spaces, eg. `P1=3.14,2.11,2.34 P2='This is a string!' P3=.TRUE.`

[http://blenderfds.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/panel/Free_Parameters.png]

In this case the `DEVC_ID='glass door breaker'` parameter is appended verbatim to the parent namelist, but no check is performed on the existance of the referred `DEVC`.

BlenderFDS knows nothing about what the user adds to free text data fields and does not check the validity of the input.

However BlenderFDS enforces the following rules to prevent the creation of a malformed FDS case file:
 # `&` and `/` characters are not allowed,
 # only single quote characters are allowed as string delimiters (eg. `P1='Right'`, `P2="Wrong"`),
 # single quote characters shall be properly matched (eg. `P1='Right'`, `P2='Not'right'`).

== Free text file ==

FIXME

== Error management ==

Whenever BlenderFDS encounters an error in entered data, an error message appears nearby the offending input:

[http://blenderfds.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/panel/errors.png]

Any error prevents the namelist from being exported to the FDS case file.

Sometimes the errors cannot be immediately detected, often because some heavy calculation is needed to discover the problem.

If errors are discovered:
 * during _file export_: a popup message warns the user that something raised an error and error messages are collected into the exported FDS case file.
 * during _file import_: a popup message warns the user that something raised an error during import and error messages are collected into the [Guide_Common#Free_text_file free text file].
