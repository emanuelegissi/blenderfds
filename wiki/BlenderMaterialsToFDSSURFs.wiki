== `Custom parameters` ==

`Custom parameters` field is used to include other FDS parameters to the `SURF` namelist group. BlenderFDS inserts the `Custom parameters` value as it is, verbatim, and does not perform any check on its validity. The user interface just replaces all the double quotes (") with single quotes (').

== `FYI` parameter ==

The `FYI` parameter contains user's comments and informations and is inserted in namelist groups when not empty:

{{{
FYI='This is a comment.'
}}}

== FDS predefined materials: `OPEN, INERT, MIRROR` ==

When entered as Blender `materials`, the FDS predefined materials (`OPEN, INERT, MIRROR`) are not exported to the FDS input file.
