#summary Blender materials to FDS SURF namelist groups

Blender `materials` are exported to `SURFs` namelist groups only if they are referenced by other `objects`.

= FDS `SURF` parameters =

The FDS `SURF` parameters are completely described in the BlenderFDS `material properties panel`. The following paragraphs list one by one all the parameters managed by the interface.

== `RGB` and `TRANSPARENCY` parameters ==

These parameters set the color and the alpha of the FDS `SURF` namelist group, that correspond to the relative rendered properties:

{{{
RGB=12,34,35, TRANSPARENCY=.3
}}}

== `Custom parameters` ==

`Custom parameters` field is used to include other FDS parameters to the `SURF` namelist group. BlenderFDS inserts the `Custom parameters` value as it is, verbatim, and does not perform any check on its semantic. The user should use paired single quotes (eg: `PAR1='This is a string', PAR2='This is another'`) for strings in order to conserve uniformity with auto-generated FDS parameters.

== `FYI` parameter ==

The `FYI` parameter contains user's comments and informations and is inserted in namelist groups only when not empty:

{{{
FYI='This is a comment.'
}}}

== FDS predefined `SURF`: `OPEN, INERT, MIRROR` ==

When starting a new project, BlenderFDS proposes the creation of the default predefined FDS `SURF` namelists:

The FDS predefined materials (`OPEN, INERT, MIRROR`) are not exported to the FDS input file.
