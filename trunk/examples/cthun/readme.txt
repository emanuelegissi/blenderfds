This is a simplified model of Castel Thun (http://www.castelthun.org)

During the period of March-June 2012, BlenderFDS received intense testing by application on a complex case study.
Following the request from the Provincia autonoma di Trento (Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy), the authors performed a fire safety study on Castel Thun, a fascinating historic castle located at the foot of the Italian Alps (Val di Non, Trento, Italy).

Built in the 13th century, the castle was the residence of the Thun noble family for 800 years. The vast monumental complex, with its turreted palace, well-constructed fortifications and extensive gardens, represents a unique example of a noble residence, entirely furnished and rich in valuable collections. Purchased by the Provincia autonoma di Trento in 1992, Castel Thun was opened to the general public in 2010 as one of the venues of the Castello del Buonconsiglio Museum.

As it is the case for many medieval buildings, Castle Thun geometry is complex and irregular.
