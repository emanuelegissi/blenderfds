<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Have you ever passed long hours
calculating and typing geometric coordinates of FDS objects by hand?
That is a really slow, tedious and error prone procedure. BlenderFDS
is the open source graphical interface for FDS that assists the user
during the input file preparation.</P>

unrelated and independent from the FDS development performed at NIST
and other organizations. None of these organizations finance,
support, endorse, or otherwise recommend BlenderFDS.

“<I>Release early, release often</I>”</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A new BlenderFDS release is out. This
BlenderFDS version shall be installed on <B>Blender 2.62 or 2.63</B>.
It does not work with prior versions and it is not guaranteed to work
with newer ones.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Many regression appeared following
the bf_export.py code restructuring. I fixed them all.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Some new small feature appeared:
management of OUTLINE=.TRUE. and the new Blender bmesh system
support. An important Blender bug prevented the release of the new
tenfold faster voxelization algorithm. What a pity.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">2012-01-02: BlenderFDS 1.2.0 “<I>Feliz
Pascua</I>”</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A new BlenderFDS release is out. This
BlenderFDS version shall be installed on <B>Blender 2.62</B>. It does
not work with older versions and it is not guaranteed to work with
newer ones.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Exported objects and materials are
now alphabetically sorted by name and by namelist group; this fixes
issue #16 (http://code.google.com/p/blenderfds/issues/detail?id=16).
Thanks to Craig Mills for his code contribution and to Antoni
Balaguer for proposing the idea.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The bf_export.py code was deeply
restructured.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">2012-01-02: BlenderFDS 1.1.2 “<I>Gott
nytt år</I>”</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A new BlenderFDS release is out. This

not work with older versions and it is not guaranteed to work with
newer ones.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><SPAN LANG="en-US">A neat new
feature: copying active object FDS properties to other selected
objects. <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/blenderfds/wiki/BlenderObjectsToFDSNamelistGroups?ts=1325501001&amp;updated=BlenderObjectsToFDSNamelistGroups#Copying_FDS_parameters_and_geometry_from_Blender_active_object_t">Wiki

future”</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A new BlenderFDS release is out. This
BlenderFDS version shall be installed on <B>Blender 2.60</B>. It does
not work with older versions and it is not guaranteed to work with
newer ones.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Fixed in this release: some small
improvement in export file header. A bright future ahead.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">2011-07-10: BlenderFDS 1.0.2 “Back
from vacations”</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The new Blender release is out and
breaks the old BlenderFDS. So a new BlenderFDS release is out. This
BlenderFDS version shall be installed on <B>Blender 2.58</B>. It does
not work with older versions and it is not guaranteed to work with
newer ones.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Fixed in this release: a Blender
supporting script has changed its path, correction applied, nothing
else.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">2011-04-18: BlenderFDS 1.0.1
“Everybody is welcome in Genova”</H2>

<B>Blender 2.56a</B> <B>beta</B>. It will not work with other
versions.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Blender API has changed again.
BlenderFDS has evolved still. Its code has been largely refactored
for speed and maintainability. Some aspects of the user interface
have been improved. Many small bugs detected by users were solved.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The annoying “UI freezes when
exporting” issue is still not solved: Blender fault. When you
export a complex file, you shall wait several minutes for the process
to complete. During the process the user interface remains
unresponsive...</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">BlenderFDS file format has changed
slightly. BlenderFDS can import and update your old files created
with previous versions: geometry is retained, but double check the
properties just to be sure that everything works well.

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Blender API has changed again. No
problem, BlenderFDS has evolved again! The annoying “UI freezes
when exporting” issue is still not solved: Blender fault. No new
features, waiting for FDS 6.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Blender API has changed a lot. No
problem, BlenderFDS has also evolved! The annoying “UI freezes when
exporting” issue is still not solved. What a pity.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This release solves some small bugs
and can be installed on Blender 2.53 beta. The annoying “UI freezes
when exporting” issue is still not solved. But it's only an
aesthetic issue. I am quite happy with BlenderFDS now!</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">2010-05-05: BlenderFDS 0.44</H2>
